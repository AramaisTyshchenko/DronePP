# Define the Area:
# Define the area to be covered in terms of its boundaries (latitude, longitude, altitude). This can be represented as a polygon.
# Break down the area into a grid or set of waypoints. The size of each grid cell can be based on the drone's camera field of view and desired altitude.
# Choose a Strategy:
# Zig-Zag Pattern: A variation of the lawnmower pattern but with diagonal movements.
# Spanning Tree: Create a spanning tree of the area and traverse it. Useful for irregular areas.
# Advanced algorithms can consider obstacles, no-fly zones, etc.
